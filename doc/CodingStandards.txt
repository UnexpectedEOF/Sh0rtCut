-----Coding Standards for Sh0rtCut-----

1. Strategy and Singleton pattern for shorteners
-----
	When creating or modifying an existing shortner class, observe the following rules:
	A. Each shortener class must implement the EndpointStrategy interface's methods in their entirety.
	<PUT "METHOD NOT SUPPORTED" RATIONALE HERE>.
	B. Each shortener class must be named "XXXStrategy", where XXX is the full URI, less any punctuation,
	of the domain name of the shortner website. Only the first letter of the domain name should be capitalized.
	Do not include subdirectories of the site. 
	C. Eacher shortener class must be a singleton. This means that there exists only one static instance of the class
	which is declared within each class file. Sh0rtCut prefers that the singleton pattern be achieved with 
	"double-checked locking." (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)
	D. Any implementation choices left to the programmer should follow the above patterns in spirit, and attempt to 
	reduce memory usage as much as possible.
