1. Statement of Mission
--------------------
Web apps, web services, and native applications alike are increasingly 
accessing URL shorteners to save space, make identifiers look prettier,
and to personalize them. 

Why? Twitter. For the most part, URL shortening is a phenomenon necessitated 
by Twitter's existence, and one which will likely remain with us prior to 
Twitter's much-anticipated demise. Until that glorious dawn, however, we wish
to provide the following to application developes through Sh0rtCut:
	i. A unified framework for access to URL-shortening services,
	ii. Homogenous, abstracted handling of network calls to shorteners,
	iii. A Java library that easily drops into Android and other Java apps,
	iv. The ability to run URL shortening proxy web services,
	v. Kooky logic features like chaining, QR redirects, and more.
