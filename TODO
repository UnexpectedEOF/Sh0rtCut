There is a lot to do. Read this and find out.


WRITING 
-------------
-The README needs work
-We need a style guide and dev manual with examples or something.


CODING
------------- 
-MAKE MORE SHORTENER SCRAPERS/API CALLERS!!
-The server/chaining/crazy feature side needs work. If someone wants to work
on this part, I'd consider any relevant pull requests after we get the 
shorteners working in a consistent manner.
-Adroid and most all default Java distros have some DOM parsing
stuff. This is what we should use instead of StringBuffer "substring" methods
with magic numbers. Anyone know of good ones (preferrably in defualt Java
libraries) that we can use so we don't have more dependencies than are 
necessary?


REFACTORING AND PATTERNING
--------------
-The current naming convention for the shortener classes kinda sucks. 
Come up with something else.
-A lot of code is getting repeated within the shortener classes. Consider
fully following a true strategy pattern whereby the DOM parsing and
specific network stuff changes for each strategy (bitly, tinyurl, etc.),
but everything else in the implementation stays the same.
